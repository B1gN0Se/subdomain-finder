## Subdomain Finder

Tested on **Kali Linux**

**Description:** This shell script program aims to enumerate all subdomains of a specified domain entered by the user. It's worth mentioning that this script does NOT VALIDATE the found subdomains!! The tool gathers a series of scripts and concatenates the results, removing duplicates in the output.txt.  

**Requirements:** Before running the installation tools and executing the tool, we need to configure our Chaos key in the system. To do this, we need to access the URL https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/, log in, and save the API key. Now, in Kali Linux, enter the command: export CHAOS_KEY=YOUR_KEY. After that, we can proceed with the steps below.

**Steps:**
```sh
git clone
```
